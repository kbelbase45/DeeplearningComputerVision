The HandWritten_Digit_Prediction.ipynb file is for the deep learning project based on the MNIST dataset. All steps are explained in the notebook. The requirement are:<br>

matplotlib==3.3.4          <br>
numpy==1.20.1              <br>
opencv_python==4.6.0.66    <br>
tensorflow==2.9.1          <br>


The '2022_July_Monday_23_20_51.h5' and '2022_July_Monday_23_20_51.npy' are model and history files that can be load again.
